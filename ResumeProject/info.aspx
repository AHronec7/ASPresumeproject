    <h1 style="text-align:center">My info</h1>

    <div style="text-align:center">Hello, my name is Austin Hronec. I am a twenty year old, currently in a programming class. <br />
         I am working on receiving some computer programming certifications to increase my knowledge in the IT<br />
         field and grab an entry level job later on down the road. I enjoy sports as well. I play , as well as being<br />
         a huge soccer fan.

         I enjoy computers as well, and technology as a whole. I have always wanted to do something in computers<br />
         or science. There are many jobs today that require people to have a proficient knowledge of computers<br />
        and technology in general. The job outlook is great as well and will only be increasing in the near future.<br />
        I think that everyone should know a little bit of basic IT knowledge. The world and its technology is only <br />
        growing and In my opinion, it will not go away.
